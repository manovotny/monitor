            "longDescription": "The Nobody's Fool (1994) team of Paul Newman, director Robert Benton, and scripter Richard Russo reassembled for this L.A. detective drama, beginning with a Puerto Vallarta prologue showing private eye Harry Ross (Newman) accidentally shot by 17-year-old Mel Ames (Reese Witherspoon) during his efforts to get her to return home. Two years later, the broke and divorced Ross lives in a garage apartment on the estate of Mel's parents, his movie-star friends Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon). The cancer-ridden Jack is not unaware that Harry is attracted to Catherine. Delivering a package for Jack, Harry encounters elderly Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh), who shoots at Harry and then dies. Harry's curiosity is provoked when he discovers that Ivar was an investigator checking into the disappearance of Catherine's first husband, written off 20 years earlier as an unsolved case, but now reactivated as Harry's sleuth-work leads him on a trail of past crimes and cover-ups. The Ames residence is actually the former Cedric Gibbons-Delores Del Rio home, and a never-completed Frank Lloyd Wright house near Malibu served as the Ames' ranchhouse."

            "longDescription": "Six-year-old Joey Scavello (Jarrett Lennon) is a very special little boy, so special that some people want him dead. \"Mother Grace\" (Grace Zabriskie) and her followers, the \"Servants of Twilight,\" are convinced that Joey is the anti-Christ, and their \"holy\" mission is his destruction. After a failed attempt to murder Joey, his mother Christine, (Belinda Bauer) enlists the aid of a private investigator, Charlie Harrison (Bruce Greenwood). When their home is besieged, Charlie moves Christine and Joey into a remote cabin in the woods. There, Charlie and Christine's mutual attraction heats up as the \"Servants\" discover the hideout and Charlie learns that one of his trusted colleagues has been working with \"Mother Grace\" all along. The thrilling confrontation may very well mean the end of Joey's life - or the beginning of the ultimate reign of terror!"

While their roles in the massively popular Twilight Saga have propelled them to superstar status, they have also proved to be very accomplished actors outside of the franchise in films such as Adventureland and Water for Elephants. However, it's not just their on screen appeal that has captured the attention of fans and media alike but their off-screen romance that mirrored their on-screen passion and had everyone talking. This film looks at their rise to fame through titles such as The Panic Room and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, their success as Bella and Edward in the Twilight franchise, delves into their romance as two star-crossed lovers fulfilling the fans' desire for them to be together and looks at their futures as bone-fide A-listers."
